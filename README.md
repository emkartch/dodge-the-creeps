This is my game for the "Your First Game" assignment in ATLS 4140.

9/3 - I started by following the [Your First 2D Game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html) tutorial in the GoDot Docs (which included using their provided assets) and it took me about 3 hours to complete.

9/7 - **First Change**: Dynamic Collision Size - 1 hour and 30 minutes
When I finished the tutorial I noticed that, despite the different sizes of the enemies, the collision size stayed consistent. I have added code to make the collision size fit the animation. 

9/8 - **Second Change**: Changed the Player and Mob Sprites - 2 hours and 30 minutes  
I changed the sprites used for the player and mobs and re-worked the collision shapes to fit each entity.

*New Bug Introduced* - When swimming around as the player, if you are holding two movement keys at once the collision box will rotate to accommodate, but the sprite will not.

9/8 - **Third Change**: Background & Title Updated - 15 Minutes   
I changed the background image and updated the title text on the game.
