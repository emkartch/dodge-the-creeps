This is my game for the "Your First Game" assignment in ATLS 4140.

9/3 - I started by following the [Your First 2D Game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html) tutorial in the GoDot Docs (which included using their provided assets) and it took me about 3 hours to complete.

9/7 - **First Change**: Dynamic Collision Size - 1 hour 30 minutes  
When I finished the tutorial I noticed that, despite the different sizes of the enemies, the collision size stayed consistent. I have added code to make the collision size fit the animation.
